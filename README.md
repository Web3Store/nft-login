![Implicit Flow Diagram](https://s3.amazonaws.com/onelogin-screenshots/dev_site/images/oidc-implicit-flow.png)

- A nft will be created on the ethereum blockchain.
  The nft will be sold and the ownership will be transfered.

- The service has to configure an oidc-client to access nft-login.
  When the user visits the service, the user has to sign a proov for the owner address of the nft.

- If the user could sign the proof, nft-login will return the nft as id in the jwt-token.
